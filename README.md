# os2-ucontrols
Project for Unicode-capable Presentation Manager controls

This experimental project is intended to explore the creation of Unicode-capable PM controls, using native GPI rendering, which could in theory be used in existing OS/2-PM applications.

The only content so far is some preliminary work on a Unicode MLE (multi-line editor).
